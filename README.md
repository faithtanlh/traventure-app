## :muscle: Project Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic has created numerous challenges for travelers worldwide. With the gradual removal of border restrictions, the tourism industry is experiencing a revival, creating a high demand for productive travel planning resources. However, the process of planning a trip overseas remains complicated and time-consuming.

Our app aims to **provide any traveler, regardless of experience or background, an easier way to plan and manage their trips overseas**. Traventure is a travel itinerary planner web app that aids the decision making process of choosing where to visit, as well as provides users with a consolidated platform to manage their travel itinerary. With the help of our app, **travelers can easily create multiple itineraries, explore different travel destinations, receive recommendations, and store the details of their trip**.
